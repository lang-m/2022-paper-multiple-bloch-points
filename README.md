## About

This repository provides [Ubermag](https://ubermag.github.io) simulation code to reproduce results from
[Lang *et al*. Bloch points in nanostrips. *Scientific Reports* **13**, 6910](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-33998-z) (2023). All notebooks hosted in this repository can be run in the cloud (see
next section on Binder), and thus the results reproduced by anybody.

Important parts of this repository are:

- `data`: pre-computed datasets
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks to re-create figures and re-compute all data
- `simtools`: A helper Python package to run the micromagnetic simulations with Ubermag.

## Binder

Jupyter notebooks hosted in this repository can be executed and modified in the
cloud via Binder. This does not require you to have anything installed and no
files will be created on your machine. To access Binder, click on the Binder
